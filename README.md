## Which Weapon?
Inspired by games like 'Wordle' & 'Who Are Ya?', this is a guessing game based around my favourite video game franchise, Insomniac's 'Ratchet & Clank' series and the weapons you can unlock in them. Includes both a (less refined & older) Java version and a ReactJS version which is playable on mobile & desktop. Screenshots of an example playthrough on mobile shown below:-

### UPDATE (05/10/2025):-
  - Renamed from "Ratchet & Clank Weapon Game" to more succint 'Which Weapon?', wrench icon added to game header as well
  - New font which closely resembles font used in the first 2 Ratchet & Clank games used throughout
  - Small white box peeking out behind autocomplete input removed
  - Confirm option now shown for refresh game functionality
  - Some comments added to code for readbility
