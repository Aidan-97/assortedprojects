# assortedprojects

## Overview
As the title suggests, this is an assortment of personal coding projects ranging from small exercises such as those in the 'Codility & Hackajob Practice Exercises' directory, to more large/complex programs such as the Ratchet & Clank Weapon Game. These are mostly in Java, with a ReactJS version of the Ratchet & Clank Weapon Game and a small core JavaScript Breakout game (in the 'Other Projects' directory) included also.

## Ratchet & Clank Weapon Game
Inspired by games like 'Wordle' & 'Who Are Ya?', this is a guessing game based around my favourite video game franchise, Insomniac's 'Ratchet & Clank' series and the weapons you can unlock in them. The aim is to, within 6 guesses, find the randomly selected 'target' weapon, with each guess showing in how many of 6 chosen categories (Console, Game, Planet/Level, Range, Rate of Fire & Cost (Bolts)) your guess correctly matches the target weapon. I created the Java version first before, more recently, trying to create a more visually appealing version in ReactJS (the Java version uses basic 'swing' package GUIs).

Possible future improvements/augmentations:-
- Java Version
  - More polished image display
  - Improve overall aesthetics

- ReactJS
  - Add more games/weapons like on the Java version
  - More polished image display here also
  - Improve changing background image functionality (sometimes fine, but sometimes shows gray background briefly before loading next image, interval that images change at seems inconsistent sometimes too)

## Other Projects
More interesting than the exercise solutions, but not as large/complex as the Ratchet & Clank Weapon Game, these are a mix of small-to-medium games/programs including: Hangman, Tic-Tac-Toe & an Anagram Game all made in Java, as well as the aforementioned Breakout game made in JavaScript.

## Codility & Hackajob Practice Exercises
Small programs, solutions to an assortment of programming practice exercises found on the Codility & Hackajob platforms. All of these were done in Java.
